# WELCOME TO HISS


HISS (also known as the Health Information Systems Sidekick) is an app to provide support in mental health for students or anyone of all ages. HISS uses the idea of snakes to help protect users as snakes are regarded as protectors and good for human life such as in Hinduism or Buddhism, where snakes are regarded as symbols of power and protection. HISS provides three main features: AI therapist, thought sanctuary, and a meditation corner. 


## FEATURES

### AI Therapist

HISS provides a comforting atmosphere for those who have trouble speaking to other people in the real world. For example, users who have trouble opening up to strangers in real life (like a therapist) may feel more comfortable using a screen as a protective layer while getting the support they need. Using AI is a new concept that many students use for daily life, using it as Google instead of using actual Google as it provides a clear cut answer every time with no effort needed. Taking this idea and comparing it to a doctor who also does research and uses their own experience to help patients, the idea of HISS’s AI therapist came to life. Many AI chatting apps have also been on the rise, so HISS bandwagons on the fact that many teenagers prefer talking to AI characters as opposed to real life people. 

### Thought Sanctuary

Journaling is a somewhat common practice, but sadly many teenagers frown upon it. Many teenagers feel embarrassed letting out their thoughts in a medium where people may be able to find and see their inner thoughts. Many teenagers also hide their journals as it provides a constant reminder of bad thoughts in their life. Many journaling websites utilise the thought of minimizing thoughts and getting rid of them to provide comfort to the user, so the thought sanctuary provides a comforting snake to eat the thoughts away.

### Meditation Corner

Meditating is a not very popular activity among teenagers, but many can relate to listening to music while working. Utilizing the ZenGlow, users are able to listen to music and be provided with ambient lighting to help teenagers calm down and meditate or do whatever they need that may need a calming atmosphere. 

## DEVELOPMENT

Millions of people struggle with uncertainty about their health every day. Many experience symptoms but are unsure whether they should seek medical attention or manage them at home. Searching for health information online often leads to confusion, misinformation, and increased anxiety. Additionally, while physical health is prioritized, mental well-being and emotional support are often overlooked in healthcare solutions. HISS was created to provide a sidekick for users to utilize as a information system or just someone to listen to their thoughts.


## OUR MISSION

Our mission with this project is simple but impactful: to make healthcare guidance easy, affordable, and accessible for everyone, regardless of background or location and to let the world know how useful AI is for healthcare. Through an intuitive user interface and evidence-based recommendations, this app aims to reduce unnecessary medical visits, lower healthcare costs, and empower individuals to practice preventive care in a way that’s both proactive and manageable.
